# Magic in the game
But you will need to do something before you will unlock it.

# Harder gameplay but interesting
Yes it was too easy. Since I made the mod it was 2k19 i noticed that increased difficulty/making normal things harder to unlock makes this game more interesting
and enjoyable

# Mod that is getting updates
Yes it does. Not everyday but I try to launch a one update per 1 to 2 weeks.
